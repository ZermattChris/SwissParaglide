      General Terms and Conditions (GTC) for Paragliding Passenger Flights. 

The passenger confirms that he/she has read, understood and accepted these General Terms and Conditions. 

The contract comes into effect with the legally binding booking by the passenger. In the event that individual provisions of these GTC should be void or ineffective in whole or in part, the validity and effectiveness of the remaining provisions shall thereby remain unaffected.

The fare shall be paid in advance in cash, online or by credit card.

The pilot is in command of the tandem Hang Glider and the passenger undertakes to follow his/her instructions. 

The passenger confirms that he/she does not suffer from any health problems (mental or physical) which could affect the safe performance of a passenger flight with a hang glider. 

The passenger is aware that participation in a hang glider flight involves risks. The [Name of the Company / The Pilot] has taken out liability insurance with a maximum cover of 5,000,000 CHF. The liability of the [Name of the Company / The Pilot] (and the Pilot) for bodily injury and property damage suffered by the passenger during a hang gliding flight shall be limited to a maximum of this amount.

Minors or incapacitated passengers require the consent of a parent or legal guardian. If such a person is not present at the time of the flight, a written declaration of consent must be submitted in advance to the [name of the company / the pilot]. 

Appointments for the conducting of passenger flights shall be agreed in advance (even at short notice). Changes to the scheduled date and/or time of the flight may be necessary due to weather conditions or for organisational reasons. The pilot makes the final decision as to whether or not it is possible to carry out a passenger flight. 

If the passenger cancels the flight, even though it would be possible to carry it out, the following rules apply to the refund of the flight: 
a) In the event of cancellation more than ... hours / days before the agreed date, the full cost will be refunded.
b) In the event of cancellation on the day before, but less than ... hours before the agreed date, 50% of the cost will be refunded.
c) In the event of cancellation on the day of the scheduled flight, there shall be no refund. 

Variant with no accident insurance for passenger
The passenger confirms that he/she has accident insurance (also covering hang-gliding flights). There is no accident insurance through the [name of the company / the pilot] (or the pilot). 

Variant with accident insurance for passenger
The [name of the company/pilot] has taken out accident insurance for the passenger, valid in Switzerland and with a maximum cover of CHF 100,000 for medical costs. Benefits from this accident insurance can be claimed after the benefits of any existing accident insurance of the passenger have been fully exhausted. The [name of the company/pilot] is only liable for claims arising from the consequences of an accident within the scope of the insured benefits and only up to the insured limit of cover. 

The pilot decides on the carrying of mobile phones and cameras.

Passengers from the USA or Canada expressly waive jurisdiction in the USA or Canada for any disputes arising from the passenger flight and acknowledge that neither the [name of the company / the pilot] (nor the pilot) agree to jurisdiction in the USA or Canada.

All disputes arising from the passenger flight contract shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts at the domicile of the [name of the company] / place. Swiss law is exclusively applicable.
