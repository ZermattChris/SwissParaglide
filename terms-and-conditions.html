            General Terms and Conditions (GTC) for Paragliding Passenger Flights with Swiss Paraglide Zermatt.
          </p>
        </div>

      Upon making a Booking, the passenger confirms that he/she has read, understood and accepted these General Terms and Conditions. 

      The contract comes into effect with the legally binding booking by the passenger. In the event that individual provisions of these GTC should be void or ineffective in whole or in part, the validity and effectiveness of the remaining provisions shall thereby remain unaffected.
      
      The fare shall be paid in advance in cash, online or by credit card.
      
      The pilot is in command of the Tandem Paraglider and the passenger undertakes to follow his/her instructions. 
      
      The passenger confirms that he/she does not suffer from any health problems (mental or physical) which could affect the safe performance of a passenger flight with a paraglider. 
      
      The passenger is aware that participation in a paraglider flight involves risks. Swiss Paraglide Zermatt has taken out liability insurance with a maximum cover of 5,000,000 CHF. The liability of Swiss Paraglide Zermatt for bodily injury and property damage suffered by the passenger during a hang gliding flight shall be limited to a maximum of this amount.
      
      Minors or incapacitated passengers require the consent of a parent or legal guardian. If such a person is not present at the time of the flight, a written declaration of consent must be submitted in advance to Swiss Paraglide Zermatt. 
      
      Appointments for the conducting of passenger flights shall be agreed in advance (even at short notice). Changes to the scheduled date and/or time of the flight may be necessary due to weather conditions or for organisational reasons. Swiss Paraglide Zermatt and/or the pilot makes the final decision as to whether or not it is possible to carry out a passenger flight. If the flight is canceled for any reason, there is no refund for Lift Passes / Ski Passes to get to the starting point.
      
      If the passenger cancels the flight, even though it would be possible to carry it out, the following rules apply to the refund of the flight: 
      a) In the event of cancellation until noon (12:00 CET) of the day before the agreed flight date, the full cost of the flight will be refunded. There is no refund for Lift Passes / Ski Passes to get to the starting point.
      b) In the event of cancellation after noon (12:00 CET) of the day before the agreed flight date, there shall be no refund. 
      
      Additional accident insurance for passenger
      Swiss Paraglide Zermatt has taken out accident insurance for the passenger, valid in Switzerland only and with a maximum cover of CHF 100,000 for medical costs. Benefits from this accident insurance can be claimed after the benefits of any existing accident insurance of the passenger have been fully exhausted. Swiss Paraglide Zermatt is only liable for claims arising from the consequences of an accident within the scope of the insured benefits and only up to the insured limit of cover. 
      
      Mobile phones and/or “Selfie Sticks” are not permitted during the flight – dropping of objects during the flight is dangerous and strictly forbidden.
      Compact or SLR cameras with a high-quality safety strap may be taken along, but Swiss Paraglide Zermatt accept any responsibility for damage to them.
      
      Passengers from the USA or Canada expressly waive jurisdiction in the USA or Canada for any disputes arising from the passenger flight and acknowledge that neither Swiss Paraglide Zermatt (nor the pilot) agree to jurisdiction in the USA or Canada.
      
      All disputes arising from the passenger flight contract shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts at the domicile of Swiss Paraglide Zermatt. Swiss law is exclusively applicable.
